## Linear-Regression-Training-Project-Predicting-Student-Performance
Predicting Student Performance Using Linear Regression
## What is the objective of the project?
This is a training project. This means that the data is not real and the project is for training purposes only. I got the dataset from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams).
The goal is to use the available features (gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, test preparation course, writing score, reading score) to predict students math score. 
## What I discovered while working on the project ?
In machine learning, you can use any feature to predict a target, as long as it improves performance and makes statistical and logical sense. However, some features may appear useful but only add redundancy and noise to the model affecting the model's generalisation and can cause overfitting.
## Dataset Overview
#### Categorical Features
1. gender: female, male
2. race/ethnicity: group B, group C, group A, group D, group E
3. parental level of education: bachelor's degree, some college, master's degree, associate's degree, high school, some high school
4. lunch: standard, free/reduced
5. test preparation course: none, completed

#### Numeric Features
1. math score
2. reading score 
3. wriring score

## Tools & Libraries Used
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
5. Scikit-learn (for modeling)
